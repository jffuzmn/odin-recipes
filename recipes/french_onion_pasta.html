    <h1>French Onion Pasta!</h1>

    <img src="../images/french_onion.png">

<!-- Description of recipe -->
    <h3>This One Pot French Onion Pasta is rich and creamy, with sweet caramelized onions, cremini mushrooms and orecchiette. Simple, delicious and easily adaptable for vegan and gluten free.</h3>

    <p>This pasta is one of the best things I've ever had. It combines my favorite food – pasta – with one of my favorite soups – French onion soup. It takes some extra time to caramelize onions, but the incredibly sweet and robust flavor is definitely worth it!</p>

    <p>I love one pot recipes because it simplifies cooking and cuts down on dishes. In addition to everything cooking in one pot, this recipe has very little prep work.</p>
