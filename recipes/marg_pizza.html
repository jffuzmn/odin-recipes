    <p>This pizza is simple, fresh and a guaranteed crowd pleaser. It’s a delight to make and even better to eat. How about pizza tonight?</p>

<!-- Ingredients needed -->
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 (14-ounce) can crushed tomatoes, preferably San Marzano</li>
    <li>3 medium garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>2 (1-lb) homemade pizza doughs</li>
    <li>8 oz fresh mozzarella, not packed in water, cubed</li>
    <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
    <li>½ cup roughly chopped fresh basil, lightly packed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cornmeal, for baking</li>
</ul>

<!-- Steps to take -->
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Make the Sauce: In a medium bowl, stir together the tomatoes, garlic, salt, sugar, pepper, and oil. (Alternatively, for a completely smooth sauce, you can blend the ingredients in a small food processor or blender.)</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F and set an oven rack in the bottom position. Dust a 13x18-inch baking sheet with half of the cornmeal.</li>
    <li>On a lightly floured surface, using your hands, stretch and press one ball of dough into an 12-inch round. Transfer the dough to the cornmeal-dusted baking sheet, and gently stretch it out again so that it maintains its shape.</li>
    <li>Spread about ¼ cup + 2 tablespoons of the sauce over the dough, leaving a ½-inch border around the edges. Slide the baking sheet into the oven and bake for 7 minutes, until the crust is partially cooked.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven, and scatter half of the mozzarella cubes over the sauce, followed by half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Slide the pan back into the oven and cook until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbling, about 4 minutes more.</li>
    <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Sprinkle with the basil and slice.</li>
</ol>
